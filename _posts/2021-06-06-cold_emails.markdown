After graduating from flatiron and completing the career services program, I was still left with a number of questions on how exactly to start many of the specific actions we as job seekers need to perform.

So, I felt it'd be a great idea to cover the biggest issue I've run into over my first week of job searching: crafting cold emails.

Cold Emailing

For those unfamiliar with the term, a cold email is just an email you send to someone you don't know in an effort to interest them in something. In our case, we want to create interest in employing ourselves as developers at the recipient's company.

Now, I found a wealth of information and studies covering who specifically at a company to email, the best subject lines, the optimal length of the email, what to talk about, how to frame it, how long to wait before following up, how many times to follow up, etc., etc. 

Essentially, I had every metric one could measure regarding an email, resulting in a formula that should produce the *best* email, with the best response rate. But, after further research, I found even emails that follow this precise formula had low click-rates and abysmal response rates; we're talking low single digits here. 

After further research, what I discovered through the anecdotes of many others is the one metric a randomized study could never actually measure: relating personally to your recipient. Emails that directly addressed the recipient, and related to them through a personal connection, really any personal connection, dramatically increased response rates.

But, I thought this was a cold email? How can we possibly relate personally to someone whom we have no personal connection to? Well, as it turns out, the world is a small place, and with enough research and a little social engineering, it's possible to find a connection to just about anyone you intend on emailing.

Probably the easiest connections are found through fellow alumni. Check to see if one of your old cohort mates has either interviewed at or is currently working for the company you are emailing. You can relate a story about how much they enjoy working there, or despite not receiving an offer, put a positive spin with some details on how they felt about the interview process.

Perhaps the company you are emailing is a small startup with a famous founder. If the company is at such a small size, who better to email than the person at the top? You can personally relate to them by letting them know how you closely followed one of their accomplishments, or how you shook their hand at that one convention on such and such day.

The fact of the matter is, there are a near infinite number of scenarios where you have had some sort of connection through a person, a place, an event, an accomplishment, whatever it may be, but it is in your absolute best interest to make sure you have one and you include it in your email if you want a response.
