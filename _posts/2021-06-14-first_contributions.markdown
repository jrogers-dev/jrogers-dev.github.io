The second biggest hurdle new developers face in regards to improving their skills is, "Where do I start?"
There are the obvious answers, such as taking additional online classes, reading, creating your own projects, but I feel the best way to hone all the skills you'll need when you are working as a developer is by contributing to other people's code through online repositories.

At first, this can seem incredibly daunting. You start poking around on Github for projects that use languages and frameworks you're familiar with, and every one is its own little ecosystem with contributors talking to each other about topics you may be unfamiliar with, or specifics to that repo that require insider knowledge to understand. It feels a little like arriving to a party alone and attempting to walk up to a group of people mid-conversation and insert yourself. It feels awkward. That's where projects like "First Timers Only" can lend a hand.

First Timers Only is a way for projects to flag their issues as great picks for someone who is completely new to open-source contribution. Typically, the issue is crafted in a way that makes it easy to understand for an individual just joining the repository as a contributor. The issue to be fixed doesn't rely on any fore-knowledge of the codebase and usually consists of documentation editing, simple changes to superficial code, etc. Pull requests for the issue will come with a template covering what should be complete before submitting it, and fellow contributors do their best to be as helpful as possible. 

To find First Timer Only issues, or "FTOs" you simply can search for that label in the issues section of the repository. There are also several social media accounts and websites that aggregate these issues for ease of access. First Timers Only, is specifically a Twitter feed that can be found here:
https://twitter.com/first_tmrs_only

There is a site as well, but it mostly serves as a list of additional followup labels which I'll discuss below:

This repo is also a list of projects with various labels associated with beginners:

Since FTOs are specifically for a first time contribution to a repository, once you've completed one or two, it's best practice to leave the rest for other newcomers. Beyond FTOs, there are several labels that provide stepping stones as you progress within a repository, and as your skills improve in general. Here I'll list what they are, and some aggregators where you can find projects that use them:

Good First Issue: Issues that are a little tougher than FTOs, allowing for deeper access to the codebase, but still approachable enough for a beginner.

Help Wanted: These issues are more in-depth, requiring greater general knowledge of the underlying language and frameworks, but not insider knowledge of the project. Sometimes projects use this label to prioritize issues as well.

Up For Grabs: Same as above, but with less emphasis on priority. The idea is anyone is welcome to come in and work on it. It may require intermediate or advanced knowledge of the language and framework, but generally nothing specific about the project itself.

Difficulty Ratings: Some projects will also label their issues with difficulty ratings. While there is no standarization here, they generally use "Easy," "Medium, " and "Hard," or "Difficult"
