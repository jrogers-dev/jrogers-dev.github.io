The second biggest hurdle new developers face in regards to improving their skills is, "Where do I start?"
There are the obvious answers, such as taking additional online classes, reading, creating your own projects, but I feel the best way to hone all the skills you'll need when you are working as a developer is by contributing to other people's code through online repositories.

At first, this can seem incredibly daunting. You start poking around on Github for projects that use languages and frameworks you're familiar with, and every one is its own little ecosystem with contributors talking to each other about topics you may be unfamiliar with, or specifics to that repo that require insider knowledge to understand. It feels a little like arriving to a party alone and attempting to walk up to a group of people mid-conversation and insert yourself. It feels awkward.

That's where projects like "First Timers Only" come in.
