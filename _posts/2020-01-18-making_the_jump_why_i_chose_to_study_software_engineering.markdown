Since I was a child, I've always had an itch that can only be scratched by knowing how things function. I would dismantle my electronic toys and games to try and figure out what exactly was going on inside them, oftentimes being scolded for doing so. It was this "need to know" attitude and my first computer, an iMac, that, at the age of twelve, pulled me into the world of programming.

I spent those initial years learning simple languages like HTML to build silly, gif-laden websites hosted on Geocities, and Visual Basic to create small games. I loved that I could essentially create anything I could imagine, and it felt like I knew a secret "machine" language that, at the time, none of my peers really understood and were easily impressed by. 

I had finished High School 2 years early thanks to an independent study program, and I knew immediately that I wanted to pursue a degree in software engineering. My cousin was currently attending Westwood College of Technology, and he suggested I apply there, and soon after, I was enrolled in their software engineering program. I breezed easily through the majority of my classes, made the dean's list, and caught the attention of many instructors due to my knowledge and young age. Often I was chosen to help assist instructors, work on software "demos" that were used at open-house events, and invited extra-curricular workshops some instructors led during their free time. Unfortunately, during my second year, my grandmother, who was my legal guardian, fell ill and I had to quickly find full-time employment. My job directly clashed with my classes and eventually I had to make the decision to drop.

Since that time, programming has stuck with me as a hobby, and I've always wanted to make the leap into professional development, but felt unprepared without a proper degree. Over the years I've looked at several different options for finishing my degree, eventually settling on Western Govorner's University, and had begun saving to cover the cost of tuition. However, this year I discovered coding bootcamps through a friend and started doing research on how they worked, how they were viewed in the industry, time requirement and cost, and found them to be superior to WGU. 

I knew I'd need a very specific bootcamp that would allow me to work full-time, access classes online, and ideally have tuition deferrment until after completion of the program. After a month of research, talking with people and comparing options, I found Flatiron fulfilled all my needs and was touted as one of the best bootcamps one can attend. 

Now, just days before my classes are set to begin, I'm so excited to finally make good on that teenage dream I had of becoming a professional developer.
