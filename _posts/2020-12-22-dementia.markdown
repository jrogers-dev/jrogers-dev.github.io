This is a placeholder blog post for my Rails and Javascript SPA, a memory-style game titled "Dementia!!!"

-Discuss stack tech

-Explain my decisions for models and relationships

-Cover node addons used for the Javascript frontend

-Explain the flow from user interaction on the frontend to data creation/requisition on the backend and back to frontend manipulation to display the result of the interaction.
